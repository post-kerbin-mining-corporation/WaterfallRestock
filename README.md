# Waterfall - Restock Configs


This is a configuration pack for the [Waterfall](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/Waterfall) mod, which applies Waterfall type effects to Restock and Restock+ models. This mod does nothing by itself; it **requires Waterfall to be installed as well**.

## Features

TBW


## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (4.2.1)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
* [Waterfall (0.6.5)](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/Waterfall)
* [Restock (1.4.2)](https://github.com/PorktoberRevolution/ReStocked)


## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
